      <img src="assets/images/me.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My name  is Eric Guerrero. I recently retired from 33 years of teaching small children (ages 5 & 6) as a kindergarten teacher. All of my teaching career was spent in Kindergarten. Being a teacher enabled me to help others to find their place in the world and in the process helped me even more. </p>

      <p>I am excited about Coding Bootcamp. Coding is something that I am very interesed in and have NO background in. This challenge is daunting, but I am looking forward to the challenge. I know this course will help me become a Full Stack Web Developer and that is exciting.</p>

      <p>Some of my hobbies include music (both listening to and playing as a dj), movies (collecting and watching) and learning new things. I have a strong need to learn and hope it helps with this class. I have been a student my whole life and it is exciting, at age 60, to be a "new student" in pursuit of a new career.</p>
